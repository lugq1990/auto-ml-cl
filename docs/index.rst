Welcome to automl-engine's documentation!
=======================================

Get best models with only **3** lines of code no matter what type of data with **automl-engine**.

How to create machine learning and deep learning models with just a few lines of code by just provide data, then framework will get best trained models based on the data we have? We don't need to care about ``Data Loading``, ``Feature Engineering``, ``Model Training``, ``Model Selection``, ``Model Evaluation`` and ``Model Sink``, even ``RESTful`` with best trained model. 

Now **automl-engine** comes in to show power!

This repository is based on **scikit-learn** and **TensorFlow** to create both machine learning models and nueral network models with **3** lines of code by just providing `file` or `sklearn` training style, if there is a test file will be nicer to evaluate trained model without any bias.
