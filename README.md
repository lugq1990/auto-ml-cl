# auto_ml
Machine learning and Deep learning is a domain that would need some code effort to get the model based on **Data**, so 
this repository is what I think could use some of frameworks that I have used many times to create a **AUTOML** 
framework.

Currently that we have used **Scikit-learn** module to create whole logic with whole steps that could be used to get 
best models.

I will try to make it workable asap.
